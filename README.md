Hello-world
===========

Yet another repository 

Ah.  OK, "edit" is a pencil icon, not a text link.  

This is my first time using GitHub.  Apparently there is a learning curve interpreting the instructions and learning the terminology.  

Second run thru Coursera info on GitHub; doing GitHub tutorial, "Create a Repo - GitHub help" 

More stuff after installing Windows desktop interface.  Now to see if I can see the same thing on my computer.
